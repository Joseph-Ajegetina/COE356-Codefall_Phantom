# ArtisanBridge   



ArtisanBridge app is a bridge between the general pulic with various artisans in their vicinity.

For the artisan, finding a customer is game of chance.For instance on campus, we see various artisans such as cobblers, tailors a
nd others roam the various hostels hoping to find  someone who needs their service at that time.It can happen that, at the time of 
their visit no one needs their service.But at the same instance there is a student in anotherhostel hoping that same artisan would
 come around.If it happens that he/she visits that needy student hostel then he can render the service, else if he does not, loses a customer.

The goal of the app is to bridge this gap between the artisan and their various customers who needs their service.
A typical use case is, a student needs the services of cobbler so goes to the app and request that service.
The artisan, cobbler in this case is notified by either a phone call or an SMS of the needy customer.The location of the customer is provided
and he goes to render the service.
This helps the artisan by saving his or her energy and time as he or she does not have to roam the various place hoping to find a customer.
This also helps the customer by making the artisan available to them at their time of need.
